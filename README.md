# Beep Boop Blockchain

Until now, the carbon credit market has only existed between companies and governments. Our blockchain-based solution applies the concept of carbon credit management to traffic commuters and simultaneously introduces the common public to the environmental and economic benefits of such a market.
Beep Boop works in 3 simple steps:
1) The government allocates B-credits (Beep Boop credits) to legitimate commuters.

2) People can avail B-credits at gas stations to pay the usual price of fuel. Those without credits must pay a higher price (a higher price determined by the government).

3) Users can sell/buy B-credits over our blockchain-based digital market.
